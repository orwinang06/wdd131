            <p>Hi, I'm Angelina Orwin. I'm a college student in Rexburg, Idaho, USA. I love to travel with my family and have grown up traveling and going on adventures together. I'm the second oldest of four kids in my family. I also have a large extended family who we have traveled with together at times. I've lived in Utah, Virginia, and Washington before going to Idaho for college. I hope to share some of my favorite travel tips and adventures with you!</p>
